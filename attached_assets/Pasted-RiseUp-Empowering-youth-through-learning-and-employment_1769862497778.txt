RiseUp – Empowering youth through learning and employment  
Many young individuals (aged 18-22) in rural and urban areas lack access to structured upskilling 
programs and job opportunities. They often struggle to find relevant vocational training, 
foundational skills, and career guidance. NGOs and community organizations like Lighthouse 
Community Pune provide training and job listings but do not have a centralized digital platform to 
connect with candidates effectively.  
Design a user-friendly upskilling and job readiness platform(web/mobile) that  
• Offers personalized learning recommendations based on skills, interests, and career 
goals.  
• Provides access to vocational and foundational training programs.  
• Allows NGOs and employers to post job listings and connect with candidates.  
• Supports job readiness through mock interviews and skill assessments.  
Features -  
• Personalized Learning Paths – Recommend courses based on interests, skill gaps, and 
career aspirations. Cultural and regional variations in skills and interests need to be considered  
• Vocational & Foundational Skilling Modules – Different Courses on digital literacy, 
communication, financial literacy, and technical trades could be hosted. Suggestions from 
external platforms could also be listed.  
• Job Listings - NGOs and recruiters can post jobs, apprenticeships, and training 
opportunities.  
• Mock Interviews & Skill Tests – Practice interviews, skill-based quizzes, and performance 
feedback.  
• Multi-Language Support – Content and platform interface available in regional languages 
for accessibility.  
• Mobile-Friendly Design – Optimized for mobile use, as many users may not have access 
to laptops.  
Good-to-Have Features

jobs as per location preference.
